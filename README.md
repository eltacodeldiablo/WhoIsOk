Summary
---
- After a disaster, I want one page that shows a list of my contacts and who and who has not tweeted nor posted to facebook or buzz since the disaster. 

Instructions
---
- Enter a time/date.
- It tells you if someone has responded or not:
- if they responded after the time/date then they are placed in the left column with the status - otherwise their name is displayed on the right.

To add
---
- Things like filtering for location (if their statuses have locations - take that into account.
- Add in more user-friendly method to input the time/date
- Maybe auto add disaster reports/times from news/wikipedia
- Figure out users friends from just celebrities/companies
